Abstract:

GamingDecoded's Forum is a web-app developed on the Sinatra Framework. Using this framework we have developed a beautiful website for everyone to signup and record their thoughts. This website is free of charge and will be maintained through 07/21/2021. If you find any bugs/errors please contact me directly at gamingdecoded@gamingdecoded.com (this is just for fun don't actually email me. My slack is "Larry_Chesbro"). Our team of 100 engineers worked countless hours to create a beautiful and seamless experience, down to each click. The user should be enthralled with the gorgeous borders, images, and colors on screen. Each user will have an experience unlike any others, their own. Starting with the seamless signup process, you must enter a username and password [preferably something better than "password"]. Next, you always have the option to leave when you're ready just don't forget to logout! Upon signup of GamingDecoded, users have been graced with the opportunity to create as many posts as our databases can handle. There is no hard cap to a user's limits so you can post all the meme's you desire! Don't like the meme? DELETE! Want a new meme in place of the old-outdated-was-featured-yesterday-meme? EDIT THAT BEAUT. Don't like your username? CHANGE.it! Bored? View the collective of posts on */posts. Enjoy your time browsing GamingDecoded.
